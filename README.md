# Arinand-DB
The open-source version of the Arinand Discord bot, built using a template from Derpy Canadian. https://github.com/Derpy-Canadian/Example-JS-Discord-Bot

Requires `discord.js`, `superagent`, and `weather-js`.

[Invite the official Arinand bot to your server!](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=579058469311741952&scope=bot&permissions=8)

**NOTE:** The bot's pretty busted atm and I don't have the motivation at the moment to rebuild it so have fun correcting the many mistakes I made
