KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Various commands will return an error in the log.
 - The clear command detects the "a-clear" command as a message.
 - The "ban" command acts as a kick command. Users are able to rejoin without ban revoking after being "banned".
 - To ban/kick, Arinand's role must be above the roles of those you are kicking or banning. I have no idea if this is an issue with Discord or Arinand itself.
